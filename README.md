# Belly Button Biodiversity

This module highlights a biodiversity study to discover and document bacteria species that taste like beef. In this module, it is reported that labs across the globe have had success synthesizing beef-like tastes from algae, fungi, and other micro-organisms, and biological researchers are convinced that micro-organisms from the human bodyâ€™s belly button have the potential to possess bacteria that has a beef-like taste. Over one hundred human belly buttons were sampled, and the [Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard](https://melindamalone.github.io/plotlydeploy/) contains the results from each test subject ID. 

Please use the interactive charts on the [Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard](https://melindamalone.github.io/plotlydeploy/) to explore the dataset.

The interactive web data visualization was created using Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, HTML, and basic JavaScript to increase audience participation and understanding. D3.json() was used to fetch external data such as CSV files and web APIs, and data was parsed in JSON format. Functional programming, JavaScript's Math library, and Event Handlers were used to manipulate the data and add interactivity to the data visualization.  The index.html file was deployed to GitHub pages to allow users the ease of clicking on a weblink to access the data visualization.
